<img class="about-img" src="roman-about.jpg">
<p>Joe is an undergraduate at Rutgers-Camden pursuing a double major in English and Digital Studies with a minor in Anthropology. In addition to serving Rutgersâ€™ Writing and Design Lab as a consultant, he also works for the Office of Housing and Resident Life as a Building Manager and at the school bookstore. His interests include reading, writing, rapping, listening to music, and playing video games. He is a diehard supporter of the Marvel brand of comics but has love for DC and others, as well.</p>
<p>He is actively involved in Greek life on campus as a member and Vice Chancellor of his fraternity, Tau Epsilon Phi. He hopes to become a New York Times bestseller after the completion of his debut novel. After graduation, he would like to pursue research in either writing, media, or digital studies, with a focus on the linguistic relationship between man and machine, such as how we communicate with artificial intelligence. He hopes to use this knowledge to continue pursuing the elimination of the digital divide worldwide.</p>
